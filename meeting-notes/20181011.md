# Meeting 11 Oct 2018

Zulip thread: [meeting 2018-10-11](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/136281-wg-unsafe-code-guidelines/subject/meeting.202018-10-11]

The main discussion was about how to finish up with the structs+tuples
PR ([#31]). We opted to pull out several "unresolved questions" into
sub-issues and call for a "final comment period" on the PR. This means
we will merge the PR next meeting, presuming nothing arises.

[#31]: https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/pull/31

We also reviewed the assignments for writing summaries of other
issues, which hasn't really happened yet. It seems like it'd be good
to get some "fresh blood" to take a look. For reference, here are a
list of other issues. For all of them, there is at least some
tentative consensus on certain issues, and so it would be great to
have people volunteer to write up a PR (similar to [#31]) that
documents what is known and pulls out important unresolved questions.
You can kind the list of issues by searching for [the writeup-needed
label](https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22active+discussion+topic%22+label%3Awriteup-needed):
